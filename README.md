rename "mark" => "mark"

mark types:

- speaker
- chiasmus instances (each level of chiasmus would have a color so you can see it)

speaker legend:
clicking one speaker icon multiple times would take the user to each instance of marks associated with the scripture

TODO: need to come up with a better way of handling when more than one person speaks
TODO: add "speaker" for "Ishamael's Daughters"
TODO: create speaker feature??
