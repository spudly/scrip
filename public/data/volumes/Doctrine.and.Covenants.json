but we do not believe it right to interfere with bond-servants, neither preach the gospel to, nor baptize them contrary to the will and wish of their masters, nor to meddle with or influence them in the least to cause them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life, thereby jeopardizing the lives of men; such interference we believe to be unlawful and unjust, and dangerous to the peace of every government allowing human beings to be held in servitude.","title":"Doctrine and Covenants 134:12","shortTitle":"D&C 134:12","volumeId":"5e4b607365da1d38c2f478f2","bookId":"5e4b607365da1d38c2f47945","chapterId":"5e4b607365da1d38c2f47f64","id":"5e4b5f583af79837e76d90ac"},{"number":28,"text":"If thou art merry, praise the Lord with singing, with music, with dancing, and with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving.","title":"Doctrine and Covenants 136:28","shortTitle":"D&C 136:28","volumeId":"5e4b607365da1d38c2f478f2","bookId":"5e4b607365da1d38c2f47945","chapterId":"5e4b607365da1d38c2f47f66","id":"5e4b5f583af79837e76d90cf"},{"number":34,"text":"Thy brethren have rejected you and your testimony, even the nation that has driven you out;","title":"Doctrine and Covenants 136:34","shortTitle":"D&C 136:34","volumeId":"5e4b607365da1d38c2f478f2","bookId":"5e4b607365da1d38c2f47945","chapterId":"5e4b607365da1d38c2f47f66","id":"5e4b5f583af79837e76d90d5"},{"number":36,"text":"For they killed the prophets, and them that were sent unto them;
